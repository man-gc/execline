<h1> The <tt>execline</tt> program </h1>

<p>
The <tt>execline</tt> program is only available when the
<tt>--enable-multicall</tt> option has been given to the <tt>configure</tt>
program at build time. In this configuration, <tt>execline</tt> is
a multicall binary implementing the functionality of <em>all</em>
the programs in the execline package; and the other programs, instead
of being executables of their own, are symbolic links to the
execline binary.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     execline <em>subcommand</em> <em>subcommand_arguments...</em>
</pre>

<p>
 execline will run the <em>subcommand</em> will its arguments. For
instance, <tt>execline cd / ls</tt> will run the equivalent of the
<a href="cd.html">program</a>, so this command will list the contents
of the <tt>/</tt> directory.
</p>

<p>
 Alternatively, if execline is called with the name of an existing
command, it will run the equivalent of that command. For instance,
if the <tt>/usr/bin/cd</tt> file is a (hard or symbolic) link to
the <tt>execline</tt> binary, <tt>/usr/bin/cd / ls</tt> will list
the contents of the <tt>/</tt> directory.
</p>

<h2> Notes on the multicall configuration </h2>

<p>
 The <tt>--enable-multicall</tt> option is a user-requested feature
to save disk space. Its goal is purely to save disk space;
functionality-wise, the execline package should be the exact same
whether it has been built with <tt>--enable-multicall</tt> or not.
That means: any execline script should work the exact same way.
</p>

<p>
 Multicall binaries have a number of issues, most of them hidden
from regular users. One user-visible issue is that their behaviour
changes depending on how they are called, which is not good
practice (it breaks naming agnosticism) despite being common in
traditional Unix. Other, more important issues are only visible
to software authors and maintainers: for instance, they make it
difficult to add functionality to a software package without
inadvertently blowing up the amount of RAM used by the software,
and they encourage bad engineering practices to work around
specific problems created by this configuration.
</p>

<p>
 I am not a fan of multicall binaries at all.
</p>

<p>
 However, it just so happens that the execline package already was
a good candidate for a multicall configuration, and several users
had been asking for it (and complaining about the amount of disk
space that the traditional execline package uses). So I did an
experiment, and it turned out that a multicall execline binary
does save a <strong>huge</strong> amount of space. Depending on
your shared/static library configuration and your libc, the gain
in disk space on Linux can range from 66% to 87%! The results were
contrary to my expectations &mdash; and simply too good to pass up.
</p>

<p>
 So now, the multicall configuration is supported for execline.
Do not expect anything similar for the rest of the skarnet.org
packages, because they're not as good candidates and it would
require a tremendous amount of work for less benefit.
